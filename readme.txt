/* Initial version of library forms */

These forms are based on bits and pieces of different library forms that are currently in use at my library. They include forms for
1. Requesting a purchase that can also be placed on course reserves
2. Placing items on course reserves
3. Submitting comments
4. Reserving rooms
5. Requesting an instruction session
6. Requesting an item through interlibrary loan

I've kept the pieces that are still functioning, updating various features for security and greater separation of duties. More soon...
